# Thaynan Freitas
<sub> Data Analyst </sub>

<p align="justify"> Bachelor of Business Administration with over 4 years of experience dealing with a considerable amount of data and strategic information, with solid experience working with Power BI, Excel, ETL, SAP, and project management. I develop powerful analytical dashboards and reports with key strategic company information that are used by managers and CEOs for decision-making. I have also developed reports and dashboards in previous roles that led to better control of sales, fleet, and production management, reducing costs.</p>

<p align="justify"> I constantly seek to improve my knowledge in Data Science, Machine Learning, Statistics, and Communication, aiming to understand the best way to extract and analyze data to extract valuable information. I have knowledge and experience with Python and SQL, with several courses, projects, and challenges undertaken to improve my skills with the tools.</p>

The best way to get knowledge is by having hands-on experience. Therefore, here can be seen some of the Data Science Projects I've created and participated in during my journey toward Data Science:

## 1. Data Science and Analytics:

| Project_ID | Project | Description | Resource Link |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |
|2| Western Australia Weather: Data Analysis | A dataset from a weather station located at Perth International Airport that monitors Western Australia. The main goal with this notebook is to get insights regarding to the climate of the place, such as rainfall patterns, average temperature over the years, months and seasons. | [Western Australia Weather: Data Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/thaynanff/western-australia-weather-data-analysis/notebook)|
|1|Titanic Machine Learning| This is a legendary competition from Kaggle, and it dives us into one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. The challenge is to create a predictive model to find out who was more likely to survive.| [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/code/thaynanff/titanic-machine-learning-from-disaster-v1)|
