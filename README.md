# Thaynan Freitas
<sub> Data Analyst </sub>

<p align="justify"> Bachelor of Business Administration with over 4 years of experience dealing with a considerable amount of data and strategic information, with solid experience working with Power BI, Excel, ETL, SAP, and project management. I develop powerful analytical dashboards and reports with key strategic company information that are used by managers and CEOs for decision-making. I have also developed reports and dashboards in previous roles that led to better control of sales, fleet, and production management, reducing costs.</p>

<p align="justify"> I constantly seek to improve my knowledge in Data Science, Machine Learning, Statistics, and Communication, aiming to understand the best way to extract and analyze data to get valuable information. I have knowledge and experience with Python and SQL, with several courses, projects, and challenges undertaken to improve my skills with the tools.</p>

**Experiences in:** Python, Power BI, SQL, Excel, Data Analysis.

# Projects


The best way to get knowledge is by having hands-on experience. Therefore, here can be seen some of the Data Science Projects I've created and participated in during my journey toward Data Science:

## 1. Python

Code challenges and projects in Python in order to practice and improve my knowledge with the language.

- [Python Challenges:](https://github.com/thaynanff/Python-Challenges) challenges in CodeWars and HackerRank in various levels.
- [Python Projects:](https://github.com/thaynanff/Projects) completed and ongoing Python projects.

## 2. Databases and SQL

[This repository](https://github.com/thaynanff/Databases-and-SQL) was created to share the projects, codes, exercises, and challenges that I developed and participated in to practice my knowledge of SQL and databases.

1. Data Modeling:
   1. [E-Commerce Model:](https://github.com/thaynanff/Databases-and-SQL/tree/main/1.%20E-Commerce%20Model) an e-commerce model developed in MySQL Workbench as part of the Database Experience Bootcamp from Digital Innovation One (DIO).
   2. [Mechanical Workshop Model:](https://github.com/thaynanff/Databases-and-SQL/tree/main/2.%20Mechanical%20Workshop%20Model) a Mechanical Workshop Model developed in MySQL Workbench as part of the Database Experience Bootcamp from Digital Innovation One (DIO).

## 3. Data Science and Analytics:

Data Analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

| Project_ID | Project | Description | Resource Link |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |
|6| Medical Data Visualizer| In this project, we will visualize and make calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas. The dataset values were collected during medical examinations.| [Medical Data Visualizer](https://github.com/thaynanff/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Data%20Science%20and%20Analytics/6.%20Medical%20Data%20Visualizer/Medical%20Data%20Visualizer.ipynb)|
|5| Sea Level Predictor | We will analyze a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880. We will use the data to predict the sea level change through year 2050. | [Sea Level Predictor](https://github.com/thaynanff/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Data%20Science%20and%20Analytics/5.%20Sea%20Level%20Predictor/Sea%20Level%20Predictor.ipynb)
|4| Page View Time Series Visualizer | For this project we will visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. We will use Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations will help you understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth. | [Page View Time Series Visualizer](https://github.com/thaynanff/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Data%20Science%20and%20Analytics/4.%20Page%20View%20Time%20Series%20Visualizer/Page%20View%20Time%20Series%20Visualizer.ipynb) |
|3| Demographic Data Analyzer |A project to analyze demographic data using Pandas. We are given a dataset of demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database and answer a series of questions. | [Demographic Data Analyzer](https://github.com/thaynanff/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Data%20Science%20and%20Analytics/3.%20Demographic%20Data%20Analyzer/Demographic%20Data%20Analyzer.ipynb)
|2| Western Australia Weather: Data Analysis | A dataset from a weather station located at Perth International Airport that monitors Western Australia. The main goal with this notebook is to get insights regarding to the climate of the place, such as rainfall patterns, average temperature over the years, months and seasons. | [Western Australia Weather: Data Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/thaynanff/western-australia-weather-data-analysis/notebook)|
|1|Titanic Machine Learning| This is a legendary competition from Kaggle, and it dives us into one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. The challenge is to create a predictive model to find out who was more likely to survive.| [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/code/thaynanff/titanic-machine-learning-from-disaster-v1)|


## 4. Power BI Dashboards 

| Report_ID | Project_Name | Description | Insights | Links |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- | -------- | 
3| Fleet Management Analysis | An analysis of a Fleet's KPIs of a given company. It's a real Power BI dashboard created by me to control strategic KPIs of the Fleet where I worked, and it was translated, having all the real names and license plates being replaced by random ones in order to protect the company's integrity. | <ul><li>Fuel Expenses</li><li>Spend per Establishment</li><li>Price per Liter, and per Km</li><li>Km per Liter</li><li>Distance Traveled</li><li>Infraction Alerts</li><li>Maintenance Expenses</li><li>Maintenance Lead Time</li><li>Preventive and Corrective Expenses</li></ul> | <ul><li>[Power BI Report](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYjhmYzFmNzEtNWM3Zi00MThjLTg5MDQtZTA1MTZjOTczOTY3IiwidCI6IjcyNmE2MjA3LTUwZjYtNDlkNS1iMGQ0LTFhNGYwNmRiYjM4OSJ9)</li></ul> |
