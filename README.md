# Projects


The best way to get knowledge is by having hands-on experience. Therefore, here can be seen some of the Data Science Projects I've created and participated in during my journey toward Data Science:

## 1. Data Science and Analytics:

Data Analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

| Project_ID | Project | Description | Resource Link |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |
|2| Western Australia Weather: Data Analysis | A dataset from a weather station located at Perth International Airport that monitors Western Australia. The main goal with this notebook is to get insights regarding to the climate of the place, such as rainfall patterns, average temperature over the years, months and seasons. | [Western Australia Weather: Data Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/thaynanff/western-australia-weather-data-analysis/notebook)|
|1|Titanic Machine Learning| This is a legendary competition from Kaggle, and it dives us into one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. The challenge is to create a predictive model to find out who was more likely to survive.| [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/code/thaynanff/titanic-machine-learning-from-disaster-v1)|

## 2. Python

Code challenges and projects in Python in order to practice and improve my knowledge with the language.

- [Python Challenges:](https://github.com/thaynanff/Python-Challenges) challenges in CodeWars and HackerRank in various levels.
- [Python Projects:](https://github.com/thaynanff/Projects) completed and ongoing Python projects.

## 3. Power BI Dashboards 

| Report_ID | Project_Name | Description | Insights | Links |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- | -------- | 
3| Fleet Management Analysis | An analysis of a Fleet's KPIs of a given company. It's a real Power BI dashboard created by me to control strategic KPIs of the Fleet where I worked, and it was translated, having all the real names and license plates being replaced by random ones in order to protect the company's integrity. | <ul><li>Fuel Expenses</li><li>Spend per Establishment</li><li>Price per Liter, and per Km</li><li>Km per Liter</li><li>Distance Traveled</li><li>Infraction Alerts</li><li>Maintenance Expenses</li><li>Maintenance Lead Time</li><li>Preventive and Corrective Expenses</li></ul> | <ul><li>[Power BI Report](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYjhmYzFmNzEtNWM3Zi00MThjLTg5MDQtZTA1MTZjOTczOTY3IiwidCI6IjcyNmE2MjA3LTUwZjYtNDlkNS1iMGQ0LTFhNGYwNmRiYjM4OSJ9)</li></ul> |
2 | Customers Personality Analysis | An analysis of the personality of a supposed company's customers.| <ul><li>Nº customers per graduation, age range and income</li><li>Nº children at home</li><li>The average nº of days since last purchase</li><li>Income per age range, and marital status</li><li>Total Spent per age range, marital status, product, and graduation</li><li>Income x total spent and average spend</li><li>Total Spent per salary range</li></ul> |<ul><li>[Kaggle's dataset page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis)</li><li>[Power BI Report](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMzNiNWIzOWItMGZhYi00MmZlLTk1MjMtZGVmMjZlNzljZTExIiwidCI6IjcyNmE2MjA3LTUwZjYtNDlkNS1iMGQ0LTFhNGYwNmRiYjM4OSJ9)</li></ul> |
