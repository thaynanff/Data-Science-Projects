# Data Science Projects
---

The best way to get knowledge is by having hands-on experience. Therefore, with this repository I intend to share the Data Science Projects I've created and participated in during my journey toward Data Science:

| Project_ID | Project | Description | Resource Link |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |
|2| Western Australia Weather: Data Analysis | A dataset from a weather station located at Perth International Airport that monitors Western Australia. The main goal with this notebook is to get insights regarding to the climate of the place, such as rainfall patterns, average temperature over the years, months and seasons. | [Western Australia Weather: Data Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/thaynanff/western-australia-weather-data-analysis/notebook)|
|1|Titanic Machine Learning| This is a legendary competition from Kaggle, and it dives us into one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. The challenge is to create a predictive model to find out who was more likely to survive.| [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/code/thaynanff/titanic-machine-learning-from-disaster-v1)|
