# Thaynan Freitas
<sub> Data Analyst </sub>

<p align="justify"> A curious, adaptable, and easygoing Data Analyst with over 5 years of experience working in a high-pressure environment, and then developing complex problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence to deal with a considerable amount of data and strategic information, as well as interpersonal and communication skills to present data-driven storytelling reports to decision-makers.</p>

<p align="justify"> Work experience extracting, cleaning, and analyzing data from various sources, including Salesforce, Dynamics, SharePoint, and SQL Server. I have built and automated 10+ ETL pipelines using Python and APIs, integrating data across platforms and significantly improving data flow and accuracy. I created 15+ Tableau dashboards to support business decision-making and rewrote legacy SQL scripts, improving query efficiency by over 60%. Previously, I helped reduce fleet costs by 20% and minimized production errors by developing Power BI dashboards with strategic KPIs. I also reduced issuing time by up to 85% through automation using SAP Scripting and VBA.</p>

**Experiences in:** Python, APIs, Tableau, Power BI, SQL Server, Excel, Data Analysis.

# Projects


The best way to get knowledge is by having hands-on experience. Therefore, here can be seen some of the Data Science Projects I've created and participated in during my journey toward Data Science:

## 1. Python

Code challenges and projects in Python in order to practice and improve my knowledge with the language.

- [Python Challenges:](https://github.com/thaynanff/Python-Challenges) challenges in CodeWars and HackerRank in various levels.
- [Python Projects:](https://github.com/thaynanff/Projects) completed and ongoing Python projects.

## 2. Databases and SQL

[This repository](https://github.com/thaynanff/Databases-and-SQL) was created to share the projects, codes, exercises, and challenges that I developed and participated in to practice my knowledge of SQL and databases.

1. Data Modeling:
   1. [E-Commerce Model:](https://github.com/thaynanff/Databases-and-SQL/tree/main/1.%20E-Commerce%20Model) an e-commerce model developed in MySQL Workbench as part of the Database Experience Bootcamp from Digital Innovation One (DIO).
   2. [Mechanical Workshop Model:](https://github.com/thaynanff/Databases-and-SQL/tree/main/2.%20Mechanical%20Workshop%20Model) a Mechanical Workshop Model developed in MySQL Workbench as part of the Database Experience Bootcamp from Digital Innovation One (DIO).

## 3. Data Science and Analytics:

Data Analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

| Project_ID | Project | Description | Resource Link |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |
|10| Split Addresses | This project was created to solve a real business problem where the company needed to split its current customer addresses column into separeted fields (street name, street number, suburb, postcode, state, etc). Many challenges were faced during the development and I explain what solution was created to solve them.| [Split Addresses](https://github.com/thaynanff/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Data%20Science%20and%20Analytics/10.%20Split%20Addresses/Split%20Address%20Script.ipynb)| 
|9| Salesforce API Extraction | A project created to extract data from Salesforce using its API, do incremental insert into an SQL Server database, and update existing rows in SQL based on the changes in Salesforce. This is meant to make the data available in Tableau for report purposes.| [Salesforce API Extraction](https://github.com/thaynanff/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Data%20Science%20and%20Analytics/09.%20Salesforce%20API%20Extraction/Salesforce%20-%20Incremental%20Inserts%20and%20Updates%20-%20Calls.ipynb)|
|8| Australian Automotive Market | A descriptive  analysis of the automotive market of Australia with the goal of finding the best car to buy that matches certain criterias. | [Australian Automotive Market](https://github.com/thaynanff/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Data%20Science%20and%20Analytics/8.%20Australian%20Automotive%20Market/Australian%20Automotive%20Market.ipynb)|
|7| Alderman's Analyzer | This project was created for the Observatório Social, and it's meant to collect data using Python, record it into a SQL Server and analyze it with Power BI from a website of the City Hall of Indaial on aldermen's propositions and analyze their performance throughout the year. | [Aldermen's Analyser](https://github.com/thaynanff/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Data%20Science%20and%20Analytics/7.%20Alderman's%20Analyzer/Alderman's%20Analyzer%20-%20Python%20Web%20Scraping.ipynb)|
|6| Medical Data Visualizer| In this project, we will visualize and make calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas. The dataset values were collected during medical examinations.| [Medical Data Visualizer](https://github.com/thaynanff/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Data%20Science%20and%20Analytics/6.%20Medical%20Data%20Visualizer/Medical%20Data%20Visualizer.ipynb)|
|5| Sea Level Predictor | We will analyze a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880. We will use the data to predict the sea level change through year 2050. | [Sea Level Predictor](https://github.com/thaynanff/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Data%20Science%20and%20Analytics/5.%20Sea%20Level%20Predictor/Sea%20Level%20Predictor.ipynb)
|4| Page View Time Series Visualizer | For this project we will visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. We will use Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations will help you understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth. | [Page View Time Series Visualizer](https://github.com/thaynanff/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Data%20Science%20and%20Analytics/4.%20Page%20View%20Time%20Series%20Visualizer/Page%20View%20Time%20Series%20Visualizer.ipynb) |
